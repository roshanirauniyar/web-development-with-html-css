                      time passes, it has an impact on how we live. A new era in technology occurs when one or more 
                      old technologies are substituted with fresher, more advanced ones. Recently, society has been
                       dealing with new technology. Life now is different from what it was in previous decades because Of
                        technology. wireless internet, the World Wide Web, the Internet of Things, Voice Assistants, Bluetooth,

                <p class="blogcontent3">Nowadays' children are constantly exposed to technology, from tablets and TV to 
                     smartphones and social media. Even while it's crucial for kids and teenagers to become tech-savvy
                      because they'll be using computers their entire lives, too much technology can be detrimental.Use 
                      may have negative physical and health repercussions. The detrimental impacts on children's health
                     range from an elevated risk of obesity to the loss of interpersonal abilities and problems with 
                     conduct. Of course, this doesn't mean parents should outright forbid technology, but it is crucial
                     for parents to be aware of the possible negative impacts technology may have on their kids and to
                     come up with plans to reduce their exposure to screens.
                     <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"><br>Technology has fundamentally altered how we 
                     communicate with one another. Even as adults, we are more likely to send a text rather than
                     make a phone call. Similar to how we frequently act differently in person compared to how we
                      do on social media. These variations are not just present in adults. Teenagers are exposed to 
                      curated information, a digital feature reel, which might cause them to compare themselves to
                      their classmates, which can be distressing. In general, because it reduces the amount of time
                      youngsters spend connecting with others, technology usage can result in social and behavioral
                      issues in children. Be careful to keep an eye on your child's usage of social media, and be
                     aware of the kinds of websites they visit and the games they play online.It's important to
                     keep an eye on your child's screen time in addition to , it's crucial to ensure they 
                     participate in social activities. Friends should be invited over for playdates, and you
                      should encourage your kid to talk to others. Enrolling your children in a sports league is 
                     another excellent approach to restrict screen time, promote exercise, and foster social 
                     connection. They will be able to exercise and interact socially with other children their
                      age thanks to the structured activities and games they will have access to.<br><br>
                      The days of having to view a movie on a VHS cassette tape or spend the entire day listening
                      to the radio in order to hear our favorite song are long gone. You can view a show or listen
                     to a song nearly immediately using the Internet and YouTube, and you can even skip the 
                     advertisements.Kids nowadays are therefore hardwired for rapid fulfilment; they understand what
                      they want and they demand it immediately.Teaching patience to children can be difficult enough,
                     but how can we counteract the detrimental impacts of an always-on culture? Limiting technology 
                     use when kids are engaged in other activities is one strategy. Limit the use of smartphones when
                     doing schoolwork, promote connection and discussion at supper, and turn off the TV while kids are
                     reading. Encourage your children to disengage from technology. Take a break from screens by going
                     outside, interacting with people, and participating in non-screen activities like board games, 
                     novels, and puzzles. <br><br>Do you know how much time your children spend each day on their 
                     devices? The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry claims teenagers use screens
                      for up to nine hours every day, while youngsters between the ages of eight and twelve use them for
                       four to six hours every day. While some use of technology is necessary for schoolwork, particularly 
                       with distance learning, parents should make an effort to limit screen time, keep track of the 
                       websites their children visit, and ensure that they are spending that time watching high-quality 
                       educational content.

                <div class="lastBlog2Content">
                     Every person uses technology in the roles they play in life. Every day, we utilize technology to 
                     pursue certain hobbies or activities. Human capacities are increased by modern technology, which has
                      developed through time. If something was operating earlier but isn't working today, it must have aged 
                      or been replaced by more advanced technology. Take transportation technology as an example. 
                      Historically, we utilized steam-powered trains, but these have been replaced by electronic trains that
                       travel more quickly than steam trains. We can communicate with our far-flung friends and family members
                        thanks to mobile technology. We are able to learn through to the internet course, content,etc. With the 
                        aid of aviation technology, we can now travel quickly to far-off locations that once required years to 
                        visit. To improve our quality of life, we use all natural resources that are accessible. Social 
                        networking allows us to locate old friends, family members, and other acquaintances as well as 
                        significant events in their lives. We can instantly communicate information with anyone, wherever in the
                         globe, thanks to information technology. We can fulfill the global population's need for food thanks to
                          advancements in agricultural technology.

                     increased sensitivity of cameras<br>
                     The range of camera sensitivity to light has expanded along with resolution, with the settings 
                     on modern digital cameras that brighten or darken a shot typically ranging from roughly 200 ISO 
                     to 1600 ISO. For those with additional budget, those spans can range from 50 (which is said to result
                      in less "noise" in the image) to 4 million (which is for photography in extremely low light).
                     According to Rick, this increase in sensitivity has greatly expanded the possibilities for low-light 
                     shooting. "The previous requirements for carrying lighting gear, or at least powerful lighting gear, 
                     has decreased," he claims. This has made it possible for photographers to be more creative.opening up 
                     the field for amateur photographers to capture photos and do tasks that previously needed a significant
                      investment in equipment, travel lighter, and get more inventive."
                     Not to be outdone, manual ISO changes are becoming more common on smartphones, like the Huawei P40 Pro,
                      which has an ISO of 409,600.However, increasing a camera's sensitivity might have downsides, such as 
                      lost details and increased grain. Ketron claims that smartphone manufacturers are aware of the problem 
                      and are taking action to solve it. According to her, "what we've seen is that smartphones have gotten 
                      better over time at performing in low light."
                     As an illustration, until recently Ketron used a third-party program to take clear nighttime pictures. 
                     No longer: "All I have to do is turn on night mode now."The way Rick utilizes the camera on his smartphone 
                     has also changed as a result of the combination of higher resolution and sensitivity. When it comes to 
                     taking pictures while on the road, he adds, "I used to frequently carry a smaller, portable camera, but 
                     now I have no problem relying entirely on my phone's camera."The reason for this is related to the new things 
                     he can do with phone-taken pictures. "One of the greatest factors was altering smartphone images," he says. 
                     However, it's now much easier to gather raw data for both still images and — more recently — motion thanks to 
                     new sensors that improve dynamic range.easy for me to modify the files in a satisfactory manner.<br>
                     linked through WiFi cameras
                     In 2005, WiFi-enabled point-and-shoot cameras first appeared in the photography industry. Since then, it has 
                     evolved into a standard function intended to do away with the requirement that photographers must insert 
                     their memory card into a computer before using it to view files outside of their camera.<br>
                     capability for sharing and storing
                     It has been "huge" for Rick to streamline his workflow as a professional photographer with the advent of WiFi.
                     "I used to export a few images on-the-fly to my phone to edit and post or send to clients," he claims. For 
                     remote client monitoring or transfer, you may now even link the majority of cameras via WiFi. If this has a 
                     drawback at all, If there's a drawback to this, it's that these types of transfers might reduce the battery life
                     of his camera.But compared to the advantages, that's a relatively tiny price to pay.Cameras with WiFi 
                     capabilities are also useful for individuals who want to publish rapidly and straight to social media. 
                     You can transfer photographs to your phone, edit them there, and upload them to social media, according 
                     to Ketron. The independent procedure is quick, simple, and "important for a lot of people" for whom social 
                     media is their primary professional platform. WiFi connectivity can also make it easier to store images in 
                     the cloud by enabling users to instantly share their work among themselves.<br>
                      Future technologies for photography
                      The technology of photography is always improving.Technology advancements in photography are continuously 
                      expanding the possibilities for visual storytelling for people from all backgrounds. Particularly when it 
                      comes to smartphone photography, Ketron observes this. It has "democratized photography," she claims, 
                      making it accessible to everyone without requiring them to have in-depth camera expertise. They only need 
                      the ability to aim and press a button. <br>
                      virtual world
                      The discipline of virtual reality photography, which includes augmented reality, is swiftly developing and 
                      has a wide range of uses. Homebuyers may stroll the halls of listed houses using interactive floor plans on 
                     their computer or mobile device. Yosemite may be explored by tourists with a few clicks. In the meanwhile, 
                     aspiring pilots may tour a Boeing 747's cockpit.All of these only scrape the surface of a technology that is
                     still very young and has the potential to make experiences available to many people that would not otherwise
                     be possible.<br>
                     specialized lenses for phone cameras
                      The development of smartphone cameras is continuing at a rapid pace. Expect to see changes specifically 
                      related to the front-facing camera. Phone manufacturers are still working to figure out how to include a 
                      more durable lens without taking up more screen real estate. But with businesses like Oppo experimenting 
                      with placing the camera beneath the phone's screen, the solution could already be here.<br>
                      photography and artificial intelligence
                      AI is progressively integrating into photographers' operations, from background blurring to facial 
                      recognition, leading to better photos.images and, in the process, get rid of tedious jobs. Additionally, 
                     the function of AI in enhancing image quality will expand when lens sensitivity and sensor power start to 
                     push more and more against the physical boundaries of reality. Photographers should expect to see AI interject 
                     more frequently in the future to automatically correct white balance, color, blur, and other aspects, enhancing 
                     the overall quality of every image captured.

                     opposite effect.According to a 2017 research of young adults between the ages of 19 and 32, those who used 
                     social media more frequently reported feeling socially isolated more than three times as often as those who

                     were observed in people who believed they engaged in more unfavorable social interactions online and who were more 
                     likely to engage in social comparison online does seem to be a connection between social media and mental health, 
                     but a key deciding element is the kind of connections users believe they are having online.
                     Effects on physical health
                     The danger of physical problems caused by technology use includes:Eyestrain Technologies that can keep a person's 
                     attention for a long time include portable tablets, cellphones, and PCs. Eye fatigue may result from this.
                     Vision blurring and dry eyes are two signs of digital eyestrain. Eye fatigue might also contribute to aches in 
                     the head, neck, or shoulders, among other body parts.Eyestrain may result from a number of technical issues, 
                     including:screen time, screen glare, screen brightness, bad seating posture, and underlying visual problems
                     Regular pauses away from the screen might help to prevent eyestrain.Anyone who frequently has these symptoms 
                     ought to get an examination from an optometrist.The digital viewing 20-20-20 rule .The 20-20-20 guideline is 
                     advised by the American Optometric Association while viewing digital screens for extended periods of time.
                     The guideline states that you should take a 20-second break to gaze at anything at least 20 feet away after 
                     every 20 minutes of screen use.performing this might decrease the eye strain that results from gazing at a 
                     screen for extended periods of time.This post will teach you more about the 20-20-20 rule.
                     bad posture
                     The manner that many individuals use their computers and mobile devices might possibly be contributing to poor
                     posture. This might eventually result in musculoskeletal problems.Many technologies encourage users to adopt a 
                     "down and forward" posture, which involves hunching forward and gazing down at the screen. The neck and spine may 
                     be subjected to unnecessarily high pressure as a result.Young people' neck or upper back pain was linked to 
                     texting on a mobile phone during a five-year period, according to a study published in the journal Applied 
                     Ergonomics.The findings showed that while most persons had short-term impacts, some people continued to have 
                     long-term symtoms.
                     issues with sleep
                     Technology usage too soon before night may interfere with sleep. This impact results from the stimulation of the 
                     brain by blue light, which includes the light from cell phones, e-readers, and laptops.This blue light is sufficient, 
                     according to researchers from a 2014 study, to interfere with the body's normal circadian cycle. This disruption could 
                     make it more difficult for someone to fall asleep or make them feel less awake the next day.People should refrain from 
                     using electronic gadgets that generate blue light an hour or two before night to prevent any possible negative effects 
                     on the brain from blue light.As an alternative, try relaxing activities like taking a bath, reading a book, or performing
                     some light stretching.
                     reduced level of exercise
                     The majority of daily digital technologies are passive. Extended use of these gadgets encourages sedentary behavior, which
                      is known to have harmful impacts on health, including:obesity a cardiovascular condition type 2 diabetes early demise
                     It may be possible to encourage a more active lifestyle by finding methods to take breaks from sedentary technologies.
                     However, other types of technology could be useful.According to research from 2017Trusted Source, active technology 
                     like smartphone notifications, emails, and wearable gadgets that encourage exercise may lessen transient inactivity.
                     This could encourage people to adopt healthy routines and increase their physical activity.Children's growing brains 
                     may be more vulnerable than adults' to the negative effects of technology and excessive use.
                     Children who use technology excessively may be more susceptible to problems such as:inadequate academic performance 
                     inattentivenes poor originality developmental delays in language impairments in social and emotional growth
                    Obesity and inactive lifestyle
                    Low-quality sleep, social problems such anxiety and social incompatibility, aggressive conduct, addiction to these 
                    gadgets, and greater BMI .The study also emphasized the value of monitoring kids' technology use and offering engaging
                    substitutes in order to educate them how to engage with these tools in healthy ways.Additionally, a study of youths
                    between the ages of 15 and 16 indicated that those who used digital media often were more likely to experience the 
                    signs of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).This only indicates that there is a correlation between 
                    using digital media and ADHD.To understand what this relationship means, more study is required.the study's authors 
                    from 2015According to Trusted Source, technology seems to have a harmful impact on children and teens of all ages'
                    general health. Researchers emphasized the need of parents and other adults monitoring children's screen use.
                    Under-18-month-olds should never see anything on a screen, and children ages 2 to 5 should watch no more than an 
                    hour of high-quality programming each day with an adult, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
